# Classiq QRISE 2024 Challenge
## "The Entangled Pair" (Adam Godel and Katie Emerson)
This repository contains our submission for the QRISE 2024 Classiq challenge. All of our annotated code is in the Jupyter notebook [glued_trees.ipynb](glued_trees.ipynb). The `qmod` and `qprog` files for our 8, 9, and 10 qubit quantum hardware executions are contained within this repository as well.
Our presentation recording can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UjiZTvJFPQSkfz91akB7ZUQjMKeroHp-/view?usp=sharing).
